# regridding-geos-chem

This repository contains the annotated Jupyter Notebook that details the regridding (and visualization) process for getting MAIAC data onto a GEOS-Chem grid.
You can run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to make sure all requirements are present on your machine if you are running this notebook locally, and of course, make sure you have a Python3 installation. Otherwise, the notebook should be self-containing!
